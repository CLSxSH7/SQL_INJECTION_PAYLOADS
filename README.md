# SQL Injection Payloads

These payloads are designed for security testing and educational purposes, aiding in the identification and remediation of SQL injection vulnerabilities in web applications.

## Purpose

SQL injection payloads included in this repository cover a wide range of scenarios commonly encountered during security assessments:

- **Enumeration**: Extracting information about the database, such as version details, table names, and column names.
- **Data Retrieval**: Fetching data from the database, including sensitive information stored in tables.
- **Error-based Injection**: Leveraging error messages generated by the database to extract information or execute arbitrary code.
- **Time-based Injection**: Exploiting delays in database responses to infer information about the database structure or execute commands.
- **Authentication Bypass**: Techniques to bypass authentication mechanisms and gain unauthorized access.
- **Order By and Union-based Injection**: Manipulating SQL queries to control ordering and combine results from multiple queries.

## Usage

Each payload is provided with a description of its purpose and usage. Users can incorporate these payloads into security assessments, penetration testing, or educational exercises to identify and exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities.
